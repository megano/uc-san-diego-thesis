This repo is a reference for my undergraduate thesis work at UC San Diego. 

My thesis was on Computer Vision, Empathy and Lie Detection in collaboration w/the Machine Perception Lab.

Given a computer vision algorithm from the MP lab, I developed a standardized test to identify who is good at detecting lies. Using the data from this test we looked for factors, including mimicry and empathy, that might influence performance. This work laid the foundation for a publication. My advisors were: Dr. Chiba, Dr.  Kirsh and Dr. Hollan.
